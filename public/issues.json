made the zsh completion work for zsh using the bash compatibility mode of zsh. It's [here](https://github.com/a8/aws-cli/commit/c0ac1993b2e153866110af72e82e1aac3bb4dfc6). I tested the Mac Mountain Lion shipped zsh, upstream zsh 5.0.2 and zsh 4.3.17 Ubuntu 12.04. In order to work around the issue described above I copied the just applied [zsh fix](http://zsh.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/zsh/zsh/Completion/bashcompinit?r1=1.5&r2=1.6) or [on the github clone](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/commit/edab1d3dbe61da7efe5f1ac0e40444b2ec9b9570).\n\nIt works. To make use of the greatness of zsh I will try to write a proper zsh compdef function in the next weeks. First I have to learn a little more about zsh ;-)\n\nI'm not sure if it is worth to send a pull request for that one

sure if you've taken a look at the work I've done with generic jsx (http://tolmasky.com/2016/03/24/generalizing-jsx/), but it is a re-imaging of jsx as a pure syntax transformation (that then could incidentally be used to represent inline HTML), which could serve these goals. Essentially, any function can be used as a JSX tag, and it has some nice benefits like being able to curry tags as well (`OurTable = <Table style = { style }/>; <OurTable>...</OurTable>`).
